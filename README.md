# 04 Pandas - Heroes of Pymoli

## Background

Goal is to analyze the purchase_data.csv of a game called Heroes of Pymoli and generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights. The final report includes information about the following, and identifies overall purchasing trends:

1. Player Count
2. Purchasing Analysis
3. Gender Demographics
4. Age Demographics
5. Top Spenders
6. Most Popular Items
7. Most Profitable Items

## Conclusions

1. Males make the majority of players (84%) that purchase optional items, therefore they produce the most revenue (over 82% of total revenue). However, females and other gender spend slightly more money per person. This potentially could indicate that players are predominantly males, and it is for this reason than they too constitute the majority of spenders.

2. The majority of players are within an age bracket of 20-24 (almost 45%) followed by 15-19 (almost 19%) and produce the most revenue (over 64% of total revenue).

3. The top spenders do not spend more than the average per person, instead their total purchase value seems to come from repeated purchases, up to a number of 5 different items. The top three best selling items (between 9-13 purchase count) are also among the five most profitable items. However, there are some items (Nirvana and Singed Scalpel) that are among the most profitable despite having been sold less than other popular items. This is probably due to the higher item price which is over 4 dollars compared to other items.
